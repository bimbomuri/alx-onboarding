<h1> DAY 2: ALGORITHM TUTORIAL </h1>


#### Hey People!üñêÔ∏è
<body>
<p> It is another exciting one today, today I learnt about Algorithms and Flowcharts. In this repository I have 3 Samples of Algorithm. </p>

## ALGORITHMS
Algorithms are simply step by step procedures to solving problems. Algorithms means breaking down a problem into bits and solving them in their bits.
There are two major ways of doing this:
* Pseudo code
* FlowChart

### Pseudo Code
According to wikipedia,Pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. There are samples of a pseudo code in the repo. They have .txt extension.

### FLOWCHART
According to google, Flowchart is a graphical representation of a computer program in relation to its sequence of functions (as distinct from the data it processes). There are samples of a flowchart in the repo. They have .png extension.

#### Tasks in the REPO :
* <b> A. 0-sum_squares</b> \
<b> To develop an algorithm to calculate the sum of squares of given input of numbers. </b>\
<b> You are going to create a white board and pseudo code: </b>
* Create the algorithm in a white board, save a screen shot the the 0-sum_squares.png
* Create pseudo code and save it as file as the  0-sum_squares.txt

* <b> B. 1-sorting</b> \
<b> To develop an algorithm that reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order </b>\
<b> You are going to create a white board and pseudo code: </b>
* Create the algorithm in a white board, save a screen shot the  1-sorting.png
* Create pseudo code and save it as file as the  1-sorting.txt


* <b> C. 2-running_sum</b> \
<b> To develop an algorithm : Calculate a running sum: A user will enter numbers that will be added to the sum and when a negative number is encountered, stop adding numbers and write out the final result </b>\
<b> You are going to create a white board and pseudo code: </b>
* Create the algorithm in a white board, save a screen shot the the 2-running_sum.png
* Create pseudo code and save it as file as the  2-running_sum.txt

#### Thank you!
#### cheers! üç∑
